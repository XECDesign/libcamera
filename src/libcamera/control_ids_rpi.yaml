# Raspberry Pi (VC4 and PiSP) specific vendor controls
vendor: rpi
controls:
  - StatsOutputEnable:
      type: bool
      description: |
        Toggles the Raspberry Pi IPA to output a binary dump of the hardware
        generated statistics through the Request metadata in the Bcm2835StatsOutput
        control.

        \sa Bcm2835StatsOutput

  - Bcm2835StatsOutput:
      type: uint8_t
      size: [n]
      description: |
        Span of the BCM2835 ISP generated statistics for the current frame. This
        is sent in the Request metadata if the StatsOutputEnable is set to true.
        The statistics struct definition can be found in include/linux/bcm2835-isp.h.

        \sa StatsOutputEnable

  - ScalerCrops:
      type: Rectangle
      size: [n]
      description: |
        An array of rectangles, where each singular value has identical functionality
        to the ScalerCrop control. This control allows the Raspberry Pi pipeline
        handler to control individual scaler crops per output stream.

        The order of rectangles passed into the control must match the order of
        streams configured by the application.

        Note that using different crop rectangles for each output stream is only
        applicable on the Pi5/PiSP platform.

        \sa ScalerCrop

  - PispStatsOutput:
      type: uint8_t
      size: [n]
      description: |
        Span of the PiSP Frontend ISP generated statistics for the current
        frame. This is sent in the Request metadata if the StatsOutputEnable is
        set to true. The statistics struct definition can be found in
        https://github.com/raspberrypi/libpisp/blob/main/src/libpisp/frontend/pisp_statistics.h

        \sa StatsOutputEnable
